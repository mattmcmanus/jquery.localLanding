{"name":"Jquery.locallanding","body":"# Localized Landing Pages\r\n\r\nA simple and non-obtrusive way to alert your international visitors of pages on your site written in their language. The plugin simply detects the browsers language setting and provides a link to landing page of your choice.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nDownload the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].\r\n\r\n[min]: https://raw.github.com/mattmcmanus/jquery.localLanding/master/dist/jquery.localLanding.min.js\r\n[max]: https://raw.github.com/mattmcmanus/jquery.localLanding/master/dist/jquery.localLanding.js\r\n\r\nIn your web page:\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"dist/jquery.localLanding.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\njQuery(function($) {\r\n  $.localLanding({\r\n    css : 'dist/jquery.localLanding.css',\r\n    languages: {\r\n      es: {\r\n        url: 'http://www.arcadia.edu/spanish',\r\n        text: 'Spanish Landing page',\r\n        src: 'http://unbounce.com/photos/spanish-flag1.gif'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nWhen you call the localLanding method, you must supply a settings object. The object has two parts, an optional CSS file and the languages you want to detect:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  css : url to css file,\r\n  languages: { \r\n    language code: ex 'es': {\r\n      url: url of page you want to give users the option to go to,\r\n      text: The text for the link,\r\n      src: *Optional* url to an image to use instead of plain text\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nFor example, you are the website for a university in the US. You have a significant number of visitors that have their language set to Spanish or Chinese. You want to unobtrusively give them the option to visit a landing page written in their language by doing the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.localLanding({\r\n  css : 'http://cdn.school.edu/js/libs/jquery.localLanding.css',\r\n  languages: {\r\n    es: {\r\n      url: 'http://school.edu/spanish-landing-page',\r\n      text: 'Spanish Landing page',\r\n      src: 'http://cdn.school.edu/img/spanish-greeting.png'\r\n    },\r\n    zh: {\r\n      url: 'http://school.edu/chinese-landing-page',\r\n      text: 'Chinese Landing page',\r\n      src: 'http://cdn.school.edu/img/chinese-greeting.png'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
